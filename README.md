# Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this simple application was to build foundations for routing in Flask and SQLAlchemy. I have recently made a very vanilla Todo-app with local storage in vanilla JS, so this will be a good opportunity to expand upon that by connecting to a database (Postgresql) and interacting with it in my app with SQLAlchemy.
